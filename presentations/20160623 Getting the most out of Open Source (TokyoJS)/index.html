			Show of hands

			<aside class="notes" data-markdown="">
				- Q: Who uses Open Source software?
				- Q: Who has successfully made a code contribution to an Open Source project?

				Goal is to get all of you to raise your hands when asked that question.
			</aside>
		</section>

		<section>
			Once upon a time, sharing code used to be the norm

			<aside class="notes" data-markdown="">
				The perceived value was in hardware, until Microsoft realized that software had huge potential
				as an industry. They were right.
			</aside>
		</section>

		<section data-background="assets/gpl.jpg">
			<aside class="notes" data-markdown="">
				The Open Source movement sought to protect the culture of sharing.
				The GNU Public License is one of the legal ways by which they have achieved this.
			</aside>

		<section data-background="assets/angry-linus.png">
			<aside class="notes" data-markdown="">
				We owe a lot of the existence of Open Source today to friendly people like this guy.

			<aside class="notes" data-markdown="">
				With all that Open Source around, being used by many of us on a daily basis, I find myself
				wondering why we don't contribute more. We owe so much to this movement, why aren't more people
				an active part of it?

		<section>
			<h4>Main reasons (IMHO)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Our debugging methods</li>
				<li>Company leadership's understanding of software</li>
			</ul>

			<aside class="notes" data-markdown="">
				The main reasons I've identified are the way we debug our code, and a lack of understanding
				software and engineering by the leadership of most of the companies we work at.
			</aside>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h4>Our debugging methods</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Gut response: I didn't cause that bug, that library is broken (sometimes right, usually wrong)</li>
				<li>
					Our "solutions"
					<ol>
						<li>Google / Stack Overflow!</li>
							<li>Workaround! (technical debt, hurray)</li>
							<li>... or worse</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<aside class="notes" data-markdown="">
				Let's start with how we debug our code. When we hit a wall, this ^ is what tends to happen.
			</aside>
		</section>

		<section>
			<p>No workaround? Let me solve that for you...</p>

			"Dear Customer, this is impossible (trust me, I know tech!)"

			<aside class="notes" data-markdown="">
				- "Not possible" or "Very expensive".
				- Like they know any better, right?
				- We're like car mechanics.
				- But who trusts car mechanics? This is bad for business.

		<section>
			<p>Being a software developer means being a problem solver first and foremost.</p>
			<p>If we don't solve the problem, who will?</p>

			<aside class="notes" data-markdown="">
				Sadly, sometimes we forget this.
			</aside>
		</section>

		<section data-background="assets/root-cause.jpg">
			<aside class="notes" data-markdown="">
				The real solution is to get to the root cause of our problem.
				Stock photo guy knows what's up.
			</aside>
		</section>

		<section>
			<p>Getting to the root of the problem, is quite literally an exercise in digging</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Is the problem in my code? (most likely)</li>
				<li>Is the problem in library/framework X? (debug it!)</li>
				<li>(Is the problem in Node.js or its dependencies? debug it!)</li>
				<li>Is the problem in the JavaScript runtime? (this actually happens)</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Don't panic</p>

			<aside class="notes" data-markdown="">
				Getting to the root of the problem, is quite literally an exercise in digging. At our company,
				I really push for people to go through these steps one by one, and not give up until the root
				cause of the problem has been identified. This can be scary, but it is totally worth it.
			</aside>
		</section>

		<section data-background="assets/bug-report.jpg">
			<h2>Report that bug!</h2>
		</section>

		<section>
			<ul>
				<li>You have a responsibility to report bugs</li>
				<li>You may be wrong</li>
				<li>Being wrong may identify poor documentation or bad API design</li>
			</ul>

			<aside class="notes" data-markdown="">
				Authors want to know about your problems so they can improve the library for you, themselves and
				others. Keep in mind that library authors can often have tunnel vision about the product they're
				working on. That can make your feedback invaluable.
			</aside>
		</section>

		<section>
			But my deadlines!

			<aside class="notes" data-markdown="">
				I understand you would be worried about your deadlines. Reporting a bug tells you nothing about
				when you will be able to deliver your blocked feature.
			</aside>
		</section>

		<section>
			Fix that bug and make a Pull Request!

			<aside class="notes" data-markdown="">
				- Fancy developers are just people.
				- Have confidence in your own abilities.
				- Jump into the project with confidence, debug your butt off, you will succeed.
				- Because existing contributors will often gladly help you when you get stuck (they will see a
				  potential new contributor in you).
			</aside>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h4>Fixing bugs in Open Source pro-actively</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>Ensures the fix works, as it will receive proper review.</li>
				<li>Will give you a public branch to continue to work from (deadline safe).</li>
				<li>Become a member of a community around software in which you have a vested interest.</li>
				<li>Improves debugging of your own software.</li>
				<li>Improves understanding of performance bottlenecks.</li>
				<li>Prevents others from wasting time.</li>
			</ul>

			<aside class="notes" data-markdown="">
				Go through the list on screen.

				That last point is especially important to me. As a community, if you can save a ton of people
				the effort of debugging the same issue, by spending 4 hours on a pull request yourself, you will
				save a lot of man-hours. I call that pretty productive. "Work smart, not hard", right?<br>
				When we acknowledge that our interests align, this should be the obvious course. Our bosses may
				not always recognise it, but in an open source world, all developers are co-workers. We're in
				this together.

			Company leadership's understanding of software
		</section>

		<section data-background="assets/dilbert-open-source.gif" data-background-size="contain">
			<aside class="notes">
				Dilbert is a bit tongue-in-cheek, but this is in essence what a lot of companies do in practice.

		<section>
			<h4>Demand the flexibility in your job to fix problems at the root</h4>

			<p>
				When your leaders fail to understand the real benefits of Open Source to your work, I believe
				your work environment has a serious flaw and you should demand better. Educate your leaders.
			</p>

			<aside class="notes" data-markdown="">
				Now if you're lucky and you work for a company where Open Source is already valued for what it
				is, awesome. But if that's not the case for you, inform your leaders and push for change.
			</aside>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h4>Open Source your own software</h4>

			<p>Always ask yourself:</p>
			<p>
				Does sharing this really create a competitive disadvantage to us?
				If not, why not Open Source it?
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Contributions at zero cost? Yes please.</li>
				<li>Street cred! GitHub is a portfolio for yourself and your company.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>The Wizcorp Pull Request challenge</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>Requires applicants to know some Git and GitHub basics.</li>
				<li>Shows us how applicants communicate with other people on a project.</li>
				<li>Shows us an applicant's problem solving skills.</li>
				<li>Allows applicants to show off their skills even when we don't hire.</li>
				<li>No silly programming tests in an interview room.</li>
			</ul>

			<aside class="notes" data-markdown="">
				- At Wizcorp we have really made Open Source part of our DNA. And we even apply it to hiring.
				- Explain the PR challenge.
				- Explain advantages (on screen).

			<h2>Super psyched to contribute yet? Sweet!</h2>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h4>Some tips</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>Most projects document how to contribute (read it!).</li>
				<li>Some projects advocate a Code of Conduct. Act professionally and respect it.</li>
				<li>Friendliness goes a long way, even when some others don't always seem to deserve it.</li>
				<li>Stick to the style of the project you are contributing to.</li>
			</ul>

			<aside class="notes" data-markdown="">
				- Code of Conduct: It protects you and others working on the project.
				- Code style: When you visit a friend’s house, you don’t start redecorating their home, right?
				  Treat a project’s code the same, some people are spending their whole days in there.
			</aside>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h4>Don't know how to start?</h4>

			<ul>
				<li>Documentation</li>
				<li>Unit tests</li>
				<li>Benchmarks</li>
			</ul>

			<aside class="notes" data-markdown="">
				If you're a bit scared to get into a particular project and want to familiarize yourself with it
				a bit more first, these are 3 ways to add value to the project without having mastered it. Users
				are often better at writing documentation than the code authors themselves. And in the process,
				you will understand the code base more and more, and will be able to start contributing code.
			</aside>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h4>Don't know where to start?</h4>

			<p>Help wanted!</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Node.js and Electron modules that have compiled parts.</li>
				<li>PhoneGap plugins which share both JS and Java/ObjC.</li>
			</ul>

			<aside class="notes" data-markdown="">
				If you have some time to spare and want to help out, there are many libraries that mix languages
				which can make it hard to find people to contribute. The mix of languages can scare people away
				from contributing. But if you're a polyglot and are comfortable around multiple environments,
				this category of libraries could really use your help.
			</aside>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h4>If you take away anything from this...</h4>
			<small>(or if you slept through this talk)</small>

			<ul>
				<li>Dig until you reach the root of a problem.</li>
				<li>Acknowledge that we are in this together.</li>
				<li>Demand the flexibility in your job to contribute fixes back to your dependencies.</li>
				<li>Have the confidence to report and contribute.</li>
				<li>If you're involved in the hiring process, use the Wizcorp PR challenge (we did not patent it).</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h4>Q&amp;A</h4>
			<small>(if I didn't ramble on for too long and overstayed my welcome)</small>

			<aside class="notes" data-markdown="">
				Please feel free to come talk with me about Open Source, JavaScript or Node in general, or
				how to become a Node.js contributor yourself.
